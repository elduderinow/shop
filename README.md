# Title: Order Form

Creating an order form in PHP.

- Repository: `shop`
- Link github: https://github.com/elduderinow/shop
- Language: HTML, SCSS, PHP, JS

## WHAT IS THE SHOP
The shop is an order form where you can order foods and drinks. 
The shop remembers your total spending and calculates the delivery time.

## PURPOSE
The purpose of the creation of this shop is to learn to work with PHP super globasl, ie: $GET, $POST, $COOKIE, SESSIONS etc. Be able to write a validation and send an email with PHP.

## FUNCTIONALITIES
- You can order food and or drinks at the same time
- The input fields are all required
- the email field takes only email and the street nr and zipcode only takes numbers.
- instead of a checkbox, you can put in an amount
- a confirmation box will display your order and calculate the total and delivery time
- the total amount ever spent is displayed at the footer.
- the express delivery checkbox keeps checked if checked.
- the Validity is done with OOP.

## PROGRESS
The order form was overal not so difficult, some parts were more challenging than others. I thought I finished, but ran in a error where the products got messed up in the sessions if you randomly pick a product.
The cookie was also confusing at the start, because you can only change it with setcookie, and this you can only use above the html tag.
I first tried to handle it as a session and an object where I would change the value like with an object or session.

I encountered several errors where the products didn't match the value of the prices etc. Luckily I fixed all of them, it took some time, but I learned a lot from it.


## THE PROJECT ITSELF & MY OPINION
Nice project where we learned a lot of new things in PHP, very good assigment. Some parts were really chalenging.
